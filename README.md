# INF222 H22

We are working on creating a gitlab where we share the solutions to the weekly experiences. In the meanwhile you can find the solution to Assigment 3, task 3.2 in this repo. 


You can see two different solutions to the tasks 3.2.1-3.2.4 in task_3-2_1-3_v1 (on defualt methond in the interface) and task_3-2_1-3_v2 (each class implements the eval function). 

And one solution for 3.2.4-3.2.6 in task_3-2_4-6, which is based on the same idea as presented in task_3-2_1-3_v2.

You can test the solution by running the main file in task_3-2_1-3_v2/src/Main.java.
